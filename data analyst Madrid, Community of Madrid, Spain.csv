449,450,Pleo,Software Engineer Backend,"Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain",Posted 1 month ago,0 applicants,Number of views 14 views,Entry level,201-500 employees,Financial Services,Oh great Another tech startup is looking for another backend engineer But is this job post even worth a read through I d say so We re not going to tell you all about the company in because that s not who we are that s why we re working together Instead let me start off by telling you about the types of people we are and the type of person you d need to be to fit right into our working style and attitude In our engineering team we geek out over great craftsmanship you ll find our Slack channels littered with latest news articles on backend trends and new resources to test out there We share upcoming conferences and then we team up and go to them We learn a language and then we teach each other We re always trying to get better at what we do and so our product is the playground for this We re always willing and interested in keeping our stack up to date and to trying out new ways of working The other thing is that we love to hire people who bring a different perspective We re a Nordic company which means we live out a flat hierarchy This means that we ll listen to an intern s voice as much as an engineering lead s The most important thing here is that we check our egos at the door and make sure that work is a happy environment in which to learn We listen to one another and we adapt continuously We re looking for someone who is excited by this we d love to have you making your mark on how we build the backend of Pleo Saying that we re all pretty opinionated so you ll have a lot of people to rubber duck with We re also not the type of people who will look down on someone because they ask a fairly straight forward question Ask our poor head of people who writes our product job posts with us Because of this we need someone to join us who shares this mindset and isn t looking to be The Next Ultimate Brogrammer out there You ll notice a red thread through this job post we re not looking for X amount of years of experience or adding flashy titles to this job post You could be a recent graduate with amazing potential or instead you could be a seasoned backender who just loves what you do We don t care we have a mixture of great people with different levels Our team is getting to the size where we can support both career paths There are opportunities to manage teams coming up in the year just as there are other opportunities to be mentored by existing and future team members And if you just want to be the ultimate master of backend there s room for experts too Quite a special part about Pleo is a lot of people in non technical roles are actually learning code on the side So if you re up for it a couple of our engineers work with them and give them some coaching on the work they ve done often in exchange for a home cooked meal We ve even seen someone go from Customer Success to becoming our Product Analyst which all started over a bowl of pasta and basic SQL cohorts So now you re getting an idea of who we are let s talk about why we re doing it We believe in changing the future of work and that s why our company expensing platform Pleo exists We think that work will change to be more autonomous and flexible Pleo is an app that delegates company spending to all employees with pre paid cards use your card virtual physical snap a pic of your receipt and you re done We take the pain away from employees having to pay out of pocket and think that if you re going to trust an employee enough to hire them you might as well trust them enough to spend company money sensibly If you say you re future of work then you really need to live it out in your working culture This is one of the reasons that our engineering team has been built with a remote first mindset we have engineers sitting between EST to CET across the east coasts of the Americas Africa and Europe As our backend engineer you could either join us in Copenhagen if you d like or sit wherever you want if you fall between our timezones Here we work with people first then coding comes into play Working as a backend engineer means you re all up with devops culture observability and all its inner quirks of metrics feature flags and testing in production We try to innovate with modern infrastructure and technologies but sometimes the good ol boring stack also is great We are big fans of getting challenged that involves pushing us around on distributed architecture finding mitigation plans to working with strange partners like old banking technologies and finding new ways of reviewing code empathically You re going to work with designers product managers customer success people and they re going to crave your solutions You re not just a code monkey although sometimes we need to code you re also an architect of happiness and simplicity We don t want to share a complicated product to our clients and you will also have a big say in that If web services have no secrets for you Kotlin TypeScript Kubernetes Docker AWS tickle your mind come talk to us applying is actually pretty easy just share a profile link and write a hello message no CV needed You know your way around Server side languages we mostly use Kotlin and TypeScript but we know you can learn new languages Cloud environments AWS Azure Heroku Google Cloud Digital Ocean and micro services distributed systems Kubernetes AWS Lambda Consul DevOps culture and tools Travis Gradle Terraform Relational databases PostgreSQL MySQL MariaDB Spanner Basic scripting Bash Python Your colleagues say you Work in English with ease it s our company language Know that Go is more than a board gameNever stop being curious and love learning about new languages frameworks working stylesAre easy to work withWould be a person that they would actually like to have a coffee with virtual or not Your mom says that you Love knowing how things workProbably are an ace at board gamesTake on challengesProbably work in IT moms Show Me The Benefits Your own Pleo card no more out of pocket spending Ability to work remotely anywhere between east coast of the Americas to European timezones or onsite if you want to Copenhagen London Berlin Stockholm Madrid Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps both company wide ones and team specific ones The last one was in Northern Ireland last December Investment in learning developing just check with your team for what s reasonable we don t have set budgets And here are some other nice gestures that we do Catered lunch in our HQ and London offices when you re here25 days holidays annual Loads of weird and wonderful niche communities to join in the company we re talking guerrilla gardening liquids tasting the Pleo band learning to code initiatives beer brewing skiing that type of thing Wild enthusiasm and encouragement from us if you want to host MeetUps events etc we ll help venue food etc Working at Pleo means you re working on something very exciting the future of work Through fintech we ve seen a way to impact how people work we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams that it should be as automated as possible and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending Based on some pretty amazing Series C round investment in 2021 we think we re onto something big So in a nutshell that s Pleo Today we are a 320 team from over 46 nations sitting in our Copenhagen HQ London Stockholm Berlin Madrid or Montreal offices and quite a few full time remotes in 16 other countries Being HQ d out of Copenhagen means we re inspired by sensible things like a good work life balance If you don t work in the office with us we ll help you get up the best remote setup possible and will fly you in once a quarter for team camps Things to look up about us Sometimes we win awards If you want to know how we hire
